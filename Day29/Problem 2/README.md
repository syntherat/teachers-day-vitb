## Day 29 - Problem 2: A. Domino ðŸŽ²

### Problem Description

Valera has `n` dominoes in a row. Each domino has two halves â€” an upper and a lower half â€” each containing a number from 1 to 6.  
Valera wants the **sum of the upper halves** and the **sum of the lower halves** to both be even.

He can rotate any domino (swap its upper and lower values) in 1 second. Your task is to find the **minimum time** (number of rotations) required to make both sums even. If it's impossible, print `-1`.

### Input

- First line: an integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100) â€” number of dominoes  
- Next `n` lines: two integers `xáµ¢` and `yáµ¢` (1 â‰¤ xáµ¢, yáµ¢ â‰¤ 6) â€” upper and lower values of each domino

---

### Output

- Print a single integer: the **minimum number of rotations** required  
- If itâ€™s impossible to make both sums even, print `-1`

### Approach

1. Compute the total of all upper and lower values.
2. If both sums are even â†’ No need to rotate â†’ print 0
3. If both sums are odd:
   - We need to rotate one domino where upper is odd and lower is even (or vice versa) â†’ print 1
   - If no such domino exists â†’ impossible â†’ print -1
4. All other combinations are impossible â†’ print -1

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)

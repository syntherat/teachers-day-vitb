## Day 12 - Problem 1: A. Boy or Girl âœ…

### Problem Description

A user on the internet wants to determine the gender of another user based on the uniqueness of characters in their username.

**Rule:**
- If the number of **distinct characters** in the username is **odd**, assume it's a **boy** â†’ `IGNORE HIM!`
- If the number is **even**, assume it's a **girl** â†’ `CHAT WITH HER!`

---

### Input

- A single string `s` (1 â‰¤ |s| â‰¤ 100), containing only **lowercase** English letters.

---

### Output

- If user is considered female â†’ print `CHAT WITH HER!`
- If user is considered male â†’ print `IGNORE HIM!`

---

### Examples

**Input 1:**
```

### Approach

- Use a `HashSet<Character>` to store all distinct characters.
- The size of the set gives the number of distinct characters.
- Apply modulus check to determine output.

---

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is number of distinct characters (max 26 for lowercase letters)

---

### Sample Test Cases

```java
// Case 1
Input: abcabc
Output: CHAT WITH HER!

// Case 2
Input: abcdefg
Output: IGNORE HIM!

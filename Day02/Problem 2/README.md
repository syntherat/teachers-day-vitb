## Day 2 - Problem 2: Same Tree ‚úÖ

### Problem Description
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are **structurally identical**, and the nodes have the **same value**.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Tree p:    1        Tree q:    1
          / \                 / \
         2   3               2   3

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Tree p:    1        Tree q:    1
          /                    \
         2                      2

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Tree p:    1        Tree q:    1
          / \                 / \
         2   1               1   2

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`
- `-10‚Å¥ ‚â§ Node.val ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`

### Solution

**Approach:** Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Time Complexity:** O(min(m,n)) where m and n are the number of nodes in each tree
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m,n)) due to recursion stack (worst case: height of tree)

**Algorithm:**
1. **Base Cases:**
    - If both nodes are `null` ‚Üí return `true` (both trees ended)
    - If one is `null` and other isn't ‚Üí return `false` (different structure)
    - If both exist but have different values ‚Üí return `false`

2. **Recursive Case:**
    - If current nodes match, recursively check left and right subtrees
    - Return `true` only if both left subtrees AND right subtrees are identical

**Key Insight:** Two trees are the same if their roots match AND their left subtrees match AND their right subtrees match.

## Day 11 - Problem 1: A. George and Accommodation âœ…

### Problem Description

George and Alex are moving into a dormitory with `n` rooms. Each room already has `p_i` people living in it and can accommodate `q_i` people in total.  
We need to count how many rooms have **at least 2 free spots**, so both George and Alex can move in together.

### Input

- The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100) â€” number of rooms.
- The next `n` lines contain two integers `p_i` and `q_i` (0 â‰¤ p_i â‰¤ q_i â‰¤ 100) â€” current number of people and total capacity.

---

### Output

- A single integer â€” the number of rooms that can accommodate both George and Alex.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```

Input:
3
1 1
2 2
3 3

Output:
0

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input:

### Approach

- Iterate over each room.
- For each room, check if the available space `(q_i - p_i) >= 2`.
- Count the number of such rooms.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
